# Snykum

![Image](https://github.com/garethr/snykum/workflows/Image/badge.svg)

A technical demonstration of building ARM images using Docker and GitHub Actions, and testing them for vulnerabilities using [Snyk](https://snyk.io).

> 1. Install QEMU using [docker/setup-qemu-action](https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action)
> 2. Install and configure buildx using [docker/setup-buildx-action](https://github.com/docker/setup-buildx-action)
> 3. Build the ARM image using `docker buildx` and [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action)
> 4. Check the image for vulnerabilities using [snyk/actions/docker](https://github.com/snyk/actions/tree/master/docker)
> 5. Push to Docker Hub using [docker/github-action](https://github.com/docker/github-actions)
